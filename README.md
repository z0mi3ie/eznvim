# eznvim

This is a total re-work of my nvim setup and a place to test changes before 
installing them into my host's neovim configs. 

This includes: 

- a simple Docker container w/ neovim and ez `make` targets to run a bash terminal to test changes
- all neovim configs written in lua and organized
- an install script that will make a `/tmp` backup of current neovim configs and install these
